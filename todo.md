on hover of the pie chart we should get the name and percent of the hovered se tion,

the category break down by day should be a correctly sized bar graph, if one thing is one hour and another is two then the bars should reflect that proportionally, also its horizontal not vertical. 

the side bar can be wider

when swaping from % to time in the side bar it does not work. could be an issue of lack of data but either way it should be handled more gracefully.
